Bike Share Instructions

This is a program I wrote for a challenge. The challenge provided a csv file with 
trip data from a bike share company over the span of about a year. 

The goals of the challenge were to:

1. determine which bike saw the most use over the time period
2. determine if riders are significantly more likely to take round or one-way trips
3. display a graph of number of rides per day
4. look for differnces in weekday/weekend use, represent visually 
5. provide business insight based on the data obtained.
