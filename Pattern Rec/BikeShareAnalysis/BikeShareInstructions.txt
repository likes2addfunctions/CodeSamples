Bike Share Instructions

This is a program I wrote for a challenge. The challenge provided a .csv file with 
trip data from a bike share company over the span of about a year. 

The goals of the challenge were to:

1. Determine which bike saw the most use over the time period.
2. Determine if riders are significantly more likely to take round or one-way trips.
	If a significance test is used, specify significance level and any assumptions.
3. Display a graph of number of rides per day.
4. Look for differnces in weekday/weekend use, represent visually. 
5. Provide business insight based on the data obtained.
