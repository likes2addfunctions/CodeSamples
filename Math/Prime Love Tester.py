### Portfolio Note
#This was a final project for a Computer Science and Engineering course I taught
#in 2015-16, I designed the program in such a way that each student was given
#a function to write that suited their abilities, not necessarily to make the
#fastest, best performing tool. It's best to keep names short as the factoring
#algorithm is not very fast.



#Before you push your additions to the code, make sure they exactly fit the parameters described in the project!
#Let's write delicious code. がんばってくらさい！
